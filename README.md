## About Me

A former intelligence officer who was the first to get a top secret tablet in front of a sitting president (then incoming President Obama). I now specialize in bringing innovative new ideas to life. With a track record of successful product launches driven by an obsessive focus on the customer and their needs. 

I love learning about everything. Currently, GitHub and repositories.
